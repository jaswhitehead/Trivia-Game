# Trivia-Game
 I have created a trivia form with multiple choice questions.  The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz.   The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly. The player cannot pick more than one answer per question.  There is a countdown timer so you must answer quickly!
